# Leap of Faith 

![Mock up of website on several differently sized devices](assets/images/mockup.PNG)

Website's purpose is to allow users to play an entertaining memory game where they have to remember the correct sequence of tiles and build a path across a ravine. This game was inspired by a scene from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade so once the player has beaten the game once they unlock a new way to play where they can't see the tiles to click.

The main aim for this project was to create a game that used javascript in combination with CSS and Html.
